I am a tropical biology student with a passion for birds of prey in the neotropic, literature and writing—particularly dark fantasy novels. I am also a tourism student; very interested in combining the knowledge I can gain through the study of the natural world with tourism, in hopes of reaching more people with practices that promote environmental conservation.
